The Wave Function
=================

In quantum mechanics, the state of a particle is described by a wave
function $\psi(x,t)$ that satisfies the Schr√∂dinger equation:

$$i\hbar \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} = \hat{H} \psi$$

where $\hat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian operator and $\hbar$ is the reduced
Planck constant.

The Uncertainty Principle
=========================

Heisenberg's uncertainty principle states that:

$$\Delta x \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}$$

This fundamental limit means we cannot simultaneously know both the
position and momentum of a particle with arbitrary precision.

Quantum Superposition
=====================

One of the most fascinating aspects of quantum mechanics is
superposition. A quantum system can exist in multiple states
simultaneously until measured. For example, an electron can be in a
superposition of spin-up and spin-down states:

$$|\psi\rangle = \alpha |\uparrow\rangle + \beta |\downarrow\rangle$$

where $|\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1$.

The Double-Slit Experiment
==========================

The double-slit experiment demonstrates wave-particle duality. When
electrons pass through two slits, they create an interference pattern on
a screen, showing their wave-like nature.

The probability amplitude for an electron to reach point $x$ on the
screen is:

$$\psi(x) = \psi_1(x) + \psi_2(x)$$

where $\psi_1$ and $\psi_2$ are the amplitudes from each slit.

Conclusion
==========

Quantum mechanics reveals a world far stranger than classical physics,
where particles can be in multiple places at once and measurement
fundamentally changes the system being observed.
