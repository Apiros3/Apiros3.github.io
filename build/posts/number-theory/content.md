Introduction
============

Number theory is the study of integers and their properties. It is one
of the oldest branches of mathematics and has applications in
cryptography, computer science, and physics.

Divisibility
============

Basic Properties
----------------

For integers $a$, $b$, and $c$:

-   If $a \mid b$ and $b \mid c$, then $a \mid c$

-   If $a \mid b$ and $a \mid c$, then $a \mid (b + c)$

-   If $a \mid b$, then $a \mid bc$ for any integer $c$

Greatest Common Divisor
-----------------------

The **greatest common divisor** of two integers $a$ and $b$, denoted
$\gcd(a,b)$, is the largest positive integer that divides both $a$ and
$b$.

Prime Numbers
=============

A **prime number** is a positive integer greater than 1 that has no
positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic
---------------------------------

Every positive integer greater than 1 can be written uniquely as a
product of primes, up to the order of the factors.

Congruences
===========

We say that $a$ is **congruent** to $b$ modulo $m$, written
$a \equiv b \pmod{m}$, if $m \mid (a - b)$.

Properties of Congruences
-------------------------

For integers $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$:

-   $a \equiv a \pmod{m}$ (reflexive)

-   If $a \equiv b \pmod{m}$, then $b \equiv a \pmod{m}$ (symmetric)

-   If $a \equiv b \pmod{m}$ and $b \equiv c \pmod{m}$, then
    $a \equiv c \pmod{m}$ (transitive)
