Introduction
============

Topology is a branch of mathematics that studies properties of spaces
that are preserved under continuous deformations. It provides a
framework for understanding the fundamental structure of mathematical
objects.

Basic Concepts
==============

Topological Spaces
------------------

A **topological space** is a set $X$ together with a collection $\tau$
of subsets of $X$ (called open sets) that satisfies:

1.  The empty set and $X$ itself are in $\tau$

2.  The union of any collection of sets in $\tau$ is also in $\tau$

3.  The intersection of any finite collection of sets in $\tau$ is also
    in $\tau$

Continuous Functions
--------------------

A function $f: X \to Y$ between topological spaces is **continuous** if
for every open set $V \subseteq Y$, the preimage $f^{-1}(V)$ is open in
$X$.

Important Theorems
==================

Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem
---------------------------

Every continuous function from a closed ball in $\mathbb{R}^n$ to itself
has at least one fixed point.

Intermediate Value Theorem
--------------------------

If $f: [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous and $f(a) \neq f(b)$, then
for any value $c$ between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$, there exists $x \in (a,b)$
such that $f(x) = c$.

Applications
============

Topology has applications in:

-   Algebraic topology

-   Differential geometry

-   Functional analysis

-   Data analysis and machine learning
