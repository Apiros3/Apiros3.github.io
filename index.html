        About:
        <p>
            I am currently in my 3rd year of undergraduate studies in Mathematics and Computer Science at Merton College, University of Oxford. <br>
            My research interests are tied to Programming Languages, specifically those related to dependent types and interactive theorem proving. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm working under Professor <a href="https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/nobuko.yoshida/">Nobuko Yoshida</a> as research assistant in the <a href="https://mrg.cs.ox.ac.uk/">Mobility Reading Group</a>, at the University of Oxford since June 2024. <br>
            I'm also working on a research project under <a href="https://www.oxai.org/">Oxford AI Society (OxAI)</a> related to stable diffusion. <br>
            I hope to work on projects related to Isabelle in the next few months as well.
