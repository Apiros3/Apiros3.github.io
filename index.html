        <!-- About: -->
        <p>
            I am currently in my 3rd year of undergraduate studies in Mathematics and Computer Science at Merton College, University of Oxford. <br>
            My current interests are:
            <ul>
                <li>Dependent Types</li>
                <li>Higher Inductive Types / Infinity Categories</li>
                <li>General Denotational Semantics</li>
                <li>Homotopy Type Theory</li>
            </ul>
            My studies are mostly focused on areas tied to Programming Languages, Algebra, and Topology.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm working under Professor <a href="https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/nobuko.yoshida/">Nobuko Yoshida</a> as research assistant in the <a href="https://mrg.cs.ox.ac.uk/">Mobility Reading Group</a>, at the University of Oxford since June 2024. <br>
            <!-- I'm also working on a research project under <a href="https://www.oxai.org/">Oxford AI Society (OxAI)</a> related to stable diffusion. <br> -->
            <!-- I hope to work on projects related to Isabelle in the next few months as well. -->
            This summer, I hope to make self-contained notes that explain datatypes of functional programs from a higher-inductive / infinite category perspective.

            In the past I've attended MGS2024, MGS2025, so you might have seen me there!
